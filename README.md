# PyML Starter — by B. Bienvenu  
A clean, beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating data structures, loops, and simple plotting.  
This repository uses **non-sensitive mock data**, making it safe for public submission (e.g., Tier IV Student Engineer application).

---

## 🔍 Overview
This repo includes small, self-contained Python scripts that show:

- looping through dictionaries  
- basic list operations  
- conditional logic  
- simple data visualization using `matplotlib`  
- clean, readable code following good practices  

It provides evidence of fundamental coding ability — exactly what student engineer roles expect.

## 🧪 Scripts

### **1. dictionaries.py**  
Looping through keys, values, and key–value pairs in Python dictionaries.

### **2. loops.py**  
Examples of iterating through lists, checking conditions, and using ranges.

### **3. simple_plot.py**  
Generates a simple line plot using mock data and `matplotlib`.  
Creates `simple_plot.png` as output.

## 📦 Requirements
**matplotlib**
C#
Install dependencies with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Future Extensions
I may expand this repository with:

- more functions & modular Python code  
- Iris dataset ML examples (`sklearn.datasets.load_iris`)  
- basic regression or classification  
- additional visualizations  
- Jupyter notebooks for tutorials

## ✔ Notes
This project intentionally avoids real dissertation data to prevent any publication or confidentiality issues.  
Safe for public GitHub usage and job applications.

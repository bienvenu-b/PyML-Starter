# PyML Starter — by B. Bienvenu  
A small collection of simple Python scripts demonstrating basic programming ideas.  
The project includes short examples of dictionaries, loops, and beginner-friendly plots created with `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`.

## 🔍 Overview
This repository introduces a few core Python fundamentals:
- looping through dictionaries
- basic list operations
- simple conditional checks
- plotting data with `matplotlib`
- loading a built-in dataset (`Iris`)
- a clean project structure for organizing scripts

The examples are short, readable, and easy for beginners.

## 🧪 Scripts

### **1. dictionaries.py**  
Shows how to create dictionaries and loop through keys, values, and key–value pairs.

### **2. loops.py**  
Examples of simple list loops and conditional logic.

### **3. simple_plot.py**  
```
Creates:
- a basic line plot using the Iris dataset
- a bar chart using a small Premier League winners dataset 

Both plots are saved as images.
```

## 📦 Requirements
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies with:

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Possible Future Additions
- small functions and modular Python code
- simple examples using public datasets
- additional plots or data exercises
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments

## ✔ Notes
- No sensitive or unpublished data is included.  
- All data used is either built-in or simple mock/practice data.

# PyML Starter — by B. Bienvenu  
A small collection of simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic programming ideas.  
The project includes short examples of dictionaries, loops, and a basic plot created with `matplotlib`.

## 🔍 Overview
This repository shows a few core Python fundamentals:
- looping through dictionaries
- basic list operations
- simple conditional checks
- a small plot created with `matplotlib`
- a minimal project structure for organizing scripts

The code examples are short, clear, and easy to follow.

## 🧪 Scripts

### **1. dictionaries.py**  
Shows how to loop through keys, values, and key–value pairs.

### **2. loops.py**  
Examples of simple list loops and conditional logic.

### **3. simple_plot.py**  
Creates a basic line plot using mock data and saves it as `simple_plot.png`.

## 📦 Requirements
`matplotlib`

Install dependencies with:

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Possible Future Additions
- small functions and modular Python code
- simple examples using public datasets
- additional plots or data exercises
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments

## ✔ Notes
No sensitive or unpublished data is included.  
All data used is simple, mock data for practice.
